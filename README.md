## Data Used
**Dataset** Currently, the dataset includes 7,253 women's international football results. All major tournament results should be complete. Some international friendlies are included. It is not an official dataset, therefore there are **A LOT** of games not included yet.

**Data Cleaning and Analysis** - MySQL

**Data Visualization** - Tableau

## Observations
Since the dataset is incomplete I'll come back later to finish my analysis and shape my findings, this is how far I go for now.
